      pygments or gnu source highlight. asciidoc can be easily installed from 
      source.

Introduction
------------
This Experimentation Project is related to my MSc. Computing Science 
at the University of Utrecht from October 2011 and it's based on previous work of
Henk Erik van der Hoek (https://github.com/henkerik/typing). 
The goal of this project was to create a useful GUI and to extend the analysis of PHP5 features.
A list of the current working features can be found below.

Requirements
------------
To be able to properly compile and use this tool the following packages must be installed:

.Packages Required
* Special version of the cco haskell library in lib/
* sglri tool (http://strategoxt.org/)
* Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/)
* asciidoc (to be able to generate the html of this README)

Installing
----------
The code itself can be compiled with the command:
[source]
----
cabal configure && cabal build.
----

or simply:

[source]
----
make
----

Usage
-----
To run the tool use with the command:
[source]
----
php5analysis -t=Option inputfile
----

.Options
* Parse - Prints the output from the parser sglri.
* Code  - Pretty prints the ast in the form on php code. This component was first implemented by Henk Erik van der Hoek and is not completely up to date. The Analyse option prints the actual file and does not use this component.
* Check - Performs the analysis and generates warnings concerning the assertions specified by the function check. This component was first implemented by Henk Erik van der Hoek and is not completely up to date, although their integration is easy since only warning generation is missing.
* Type - Performs the analysis and prints the lattice for all labels. This information might be hard to grasp if not familiarized with code.
* Flow - Prints the Flow instance for Node and the nodes elements that are used by TreeDot.
* TreeDot - Prints a dot file representing the AST.
* Simplify - Prints the code using Code after simplifying the AST.
* DumpIterations - Dumps all information used by Analyse to build the website. This information are dots files for each iteration of the control flow annotated with the lattice.
* Analyse - Generates a website under the directory of the testfile with the name (testfile ++ "output"). If the website seems broken a possible reason might be that the link to the css and the js script is broken since these are hardcoded for simplicity. Change those links in WebApp/WebApp.hs
* Debug - Prints both Flow and Code.

The analysis
------------
The goal of the analysis is to discover for each program-point which
variables are in scope and what their possible types are at that point.

This work follows Henk Erik's approach by specifying the 
problem as a monotone framework instance for a forward analysis and by solving the instance using a work-list algorithm. 
The theory behind monotone frameworks is described in Principles of Program Analysis by Nielson, Nielson & Hankin (NNH). 

During the execution of each transfer function constraints for the PHP expression at hand are generated, 
and the type of an expression is found by resolving these constraints. 
This idea was described by Camphuijsen in his thesis "Soft typing and analyses on PHP programs".

General Architecture 
--------------------

Following Henk's work the code base continues to be clearly separated between the monotone framework and a generic work-list algorithm
on one side and the framework instances on the other side. 

The soft typing analyses contains two distinct phases. In the first phase an instance of the monotone
framework is specified and solved. The result is an IntMap where the key represents the iteration number and the value
a mapping between variable and type set for any given program point. 

The second phase was split into two variants:

a) Henk's initial work whereas this result is used to check wether these types match the types 
we expect. 

b) Website containing all relevant information to visualization of the analysis. Particularly important are the annotated control flow graphs where we can view the lattice for each program point.

The second process doesn't specify or solve a monotone framework instance and could be considered a post processing step. 

All previous executables were collapsed to options in one executable and also a more refined file structure was created to help code navigation.

Notes on the language
---------------------

.Useful functions
* varmanage functions (tests/varmanage/*)
* var_dump (tests/basicdatatypes/scalar/boolean/boolcheck.php)
* gettype  (tests/basicdatatypes/gettype.php)
* error_reporting(E_ALL);
* ini_set('display_errors', true);
* ini_set('html_errors', false);
* settype()
* function_exists()


Notes for new developers
------------------------
.The typical procedure to implement a new feature is
* New constructor to 'Node' in Base.ag
* New production to 'toTree' in Base.ag
* Probably rules for all attributes in Flow.ag
* Debug with option Flow and check new control flow
* Add new constraints and (possibly new transfer function) in Typing.ag
* Debug with option Type
* Support for PP/PPcfg.ag and PP/PPast.ag
* Run with option Analyse

Sometimes it's difficult to know how PHP works under the hoods. 
I used the *Vulcan Logic Dumper* has a debugger and it was quite helpful.
