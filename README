Introduction
------------
This Experimentation Project is related to my MSc. Computing Science 
at the University of Utrecht from October 2011 and it's based on previous work of
Henk Erik van der Hoek (https://github.com/henkerik/typing). 
The goal of the project continues to be static type inference of variables in 
PHP programs to provide suitable warnings whenever a program is likely to be incorrect. 

Installing
----------
All of these can be installed using cabal. The code itself can
be compiled with the command:

[source]
----
cabal configure && cabal build.
----

or simply:

[source]
----
make
----

Running
-------
To analyze the file input.php use:

[source]
----
./run
----

To run the testsuite type:

[source]
----
typing_tester
----

The analysis
------------
The goal of the analysis is to find for each program-point in the program which
variables are in scope and what their possible types are at that point.
Following the initial approach by Henk Erik this was realized by specifying the 
problem as a monotone framework instance for a forward analysis and by solving the instance using a iterative work-list algorithm. 
The theory behind monotone frameworks is described in Principles of Program Analysis by Nielson, Nielson & Hankin (NNH). 
During the execution of each transfer function constraints for the PHP expression at hand are generated, 
and the type of an expression is found by resolving these constraints. This idea was described 
by Camphuijsen in his thesis "Soft typing and analyses on PHP programs".


General Architecture 
--------------------
(heavily based on Henk Erik's work)

At the moment the code base is clearly separated between the monotone framework and a generic work-list algorithm
on one side and the framework instances on the other side. Beside soft typing, several other analyses were
implemented as well (*). This was done to get the boundary between framework and instances clear. 
These additional analyses all operate on the While language, a small imperative language defined by NNH. 

The soft typing analyses contains two distinct phases. In the first phase an instance of the monotone
framework is specified and solved. The result is a mapping between variable and type for any given 
program point. In the second phase this result is used to check wether these types match the types 
we expect. The second process doesn't specify or solve a monotone framework instance and could be 
considered a post processing step. 

The following files and directories might be of special interest:

(*) : Currently these analyses additional analyses don't compile due to recent changes in the Flowable class
